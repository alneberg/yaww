Yet Another Work launching Wrapper

What's this?
------------
This is a python tool for running computational protocols and
pipelines on SLURM systems (other systems might be added in the future).

Why is this?
------------
The main reason for creating my own job launching script is because its a good programming exercise.

Does it work?
-------------
No, it is unfortunately not yet functioning.
